    var body: some View {
        BlockView()
        // Exercise 3.1: Make BlockView draggable and follow your finger
        // Exercise 3.2: Animate only the movement back to the original position when lifting up your finger
        // Exercise 3.3: Add scaleEffect when Block is being moved
        // Exercise 3.4: Change the rectangles color based on its position

        // Hint 1: DragGesture and .offset are your friend
        // Hint 2: Use minimumDistance: 0 to react to touch events without movements as well
        // Hint 3: An animation duration of 0 can help you deactivate animations for specic usecases
